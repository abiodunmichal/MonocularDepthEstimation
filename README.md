# Monocular Depth Estimation With MiDaS on Android Mobile Devices
This project is developed for the CMP721 - Computational Photography PhD course given by Ahmet Selman BozkÄ±r from Computer Engineering Department at Hacettepe University.

In this project, monocular depth estimation is implemented using pre-trained MiDaS deep learning model. Tensorflow Lite is used as a backend inference engine in the project. The engine uses the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) v2.1 small as an inference model. The model can be downloaded from model's [Tensorflow Hub page](https://tfhub.dev/intel/midas/v2_1_small/1).

The model performance mostly depends on the device specifications. The model tested on two devices detailed in table below:

| **Device**              | **OS**           | **Inference Time (ms)** | **Frame Per Second** |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro | Android 11       | 70-80                   | 6                    |
|     Lenovo K6 Note      |     Android 7    |     500-700             |     1                |
