# Monocular Depth Estimation With MiDaS on Android Mobile Devices
This project is developed for the CMP721 - Computational Photography PhD course given by Ahmet Selman BozkÄ±r from Computer Engineering Department at Hacettepe University.

In this project, monocular depth estimation is implemented using pre-trained MiDaS deep learning model. Tensorflow Lite is used as a backend inference engine in the project. The engine uses the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) v2.1 small as an inference model. The model can be downloaded from model's [Tensorflow Hub page](https://tfhub.dev/intel/midas/v2_1_small/1).
