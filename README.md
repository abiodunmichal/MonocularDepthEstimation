# Monocular Depth Estimation With MiDaS on Android Mobile Devices
In this project, Tensorflow Lite is used as a backend inference engine. The engine uses the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) v2.1 small as an inference model.
The model can be downloaded from model's [Tensorflow Hub page](https://tfhub.dev/intel/midas/v2_1_small/1).
